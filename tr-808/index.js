/**
 * The tr-808 bass drum is often used as a pitched bass instrument. The 808 bass
 * drum had a 'Decay' parameter, and setting this to the max value yields a
 * long, low, resonant sound that is a staple of trap and other electronica
 * originating from Atlanta, GA. However, the original tr-808 was not tuned to
 * any particular scale, and the 'tuning' parameter on a 808 bass does not
 * significantly affect the pitch of the decay portion of the sound.
 *
 * The sample in the technique library below was re-tuned down by about 22
 * cents. The result is a pitched bass sound that is pre-tuned to g1 note
 * (relative to a4 === 440hz). This results in a low ringing frequency of the
 * tuned bass sound at approximately 49hz.
